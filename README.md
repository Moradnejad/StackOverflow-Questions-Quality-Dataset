# StackOverflow-Questions-Quality-Dataset

We collected 60,000 Stack Overflow questions from 2016-2020 and classified them into three categories: 

1. HQ: High-quality posts without a single edit.
2. LQ_EDIT: Low-quality posts with a negative score, and multiple community edits. However, they still remain open after those changes.
3. LQ_CLOSE: Low-quality posts that were closed by the community without a single edit.

## Notes
- Questions are sorted according to Question Id.
- Question body is in HTML format.
- All dates are in UTC format.
